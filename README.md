# Go MIDI

Go implementation of a library to represent MIDI data.

This began as a passion project to learn and implement a workable amount of the MIDI 1.0 specification from scratch so I could have complete control over certain specific digital instruments and DAW controls.

## Resources

### Official Specifications

[Official MIDI Specifications](https://www.midi.org/specifications) - the official MIDI 1.0 and 2.0 specifications from the MIDI Alliance.

### Books

[_The Midi Manual_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0367549980?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) by David Miles Huber. Reading this book was the catalyst for breaking into MIDI programming and gave me enough of a technical foundation to begin this project.
